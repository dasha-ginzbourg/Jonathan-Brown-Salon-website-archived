<h2>Beauty without compromise</h2>
<p>It may sound cliché, but no matter how beautiful the packaging,  it's what's inside the bottle that really counts. Eufora has made it their  responsibility to create products with unparalleled performance that respect the environment and your health.  They strive to create products that not only provide performance, but maintain a high level of integrity with unique ingredients and performance benefits above all.</p>
<p>Eufora's advanced technology utilizes important botanical extracts that have been scientifically proven to benefit the hair, scalp and skin. Eufora never uses fluff ingredients that sound good on the label, but don't provide any real benefit. You can count on Eufora to deliver substance without hype.</p>

<h2>Power of nature</h2>
<p>Designed to protect, preserve and promote health of color treated and chemically serviced hair, Eufora has used its unique blend of botanical extracts and Aloe Vera properties to design the most natural way to keep your hair looking beautiful.</p>
<p>Most products use water as a base but Eufora has raised the performance standard by using certified organic Aloe Vera gel as our product base.  Known as the miracle plant, aloe is rich in over 200 biologically active substances, including 75 nutrients, 20 minerals and 12 vitamins.  Aloe contains elements that are essential to cellular healing, renewal and growth.  Aloe also delivers amazing antibacterial, anti-viral and antiseptic properties. It is a naturally effective solution to help alleviate the symptoms caused by skin and scalp conditions such as acne, dandruff and seborrhea. Eufora is the only salon professional product line to provide certified organic Aloe Vera in the optimum quality and concentration required to deliver its true power.</p>
<p>Along with Aloe Vera, Eufora products utilize the most advanced botanical ingredients available, as well as pure essential oils to fragrance all products for an aromatherapy experience.<p/>
<p>Eufora products are known for quality ingredients, but almost as impressive are the ingredients missing from Eufora products. They don’t use synthetic fragrances, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, carcinogenic or suspected carcinogenic ingredients in any of their products.</p>
